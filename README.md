# CNN-COVID-Stock-Predictor-
My team and I made a machine learning model that can predict stock prices for 7 days. As we are getting our data through an API and by analyzing those data (Historical data) we are going to predict the next 7 days stock price, we can categorize this machine learning model as a supervised machine learning model. This particular problem can also be defined as time series data prediction model as the data is changing chronologically. The data we are getting from the API is labelled data. 

#CNN-Model-
CNN algorithm is a deep learning algorithm that was originally developed to process image data but recently it shows amazing results in predicting sequential data analysis, exactly the one we are doing in this project.

# CNN-COVID-Stock-Predictor-
My team and I made a machine learning model that can predict stock prices for 7 days. As we are getting our data through an API and by analyzing those data (Historical data) we are going to predict the next 7 days stock price, we can categorize this machine learning model as a supervised machine learning model. This particular problem can also be defined as time series data prediction model as the data is changing chronologically. The data we are getting from the API is labelled data. 

CNN Model Explanation: 
CNN algorithm is a deep learning algorithm that was originally developed to process image data but recently it shows amazing results in predicting sequential data analysis, exactly the one we are doing in this project.  The reason we chose this model is because a lot of the data now isn’t indicative of traditional historical prices and it might be better to have something that’s closer to the most recent stock price just because of how much unknown there is in general so a CNN is best.

Special Thanks to my teammates Christoper, Tanjeel, Zian, and Berkalp
